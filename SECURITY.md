# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in LogoWallpaper, please report it privately so we can fix the issue before it is publicly disclosed.

- Use the [GitHub Security Advisory form](https://github.com/samzong/LogoWallpaper/security/advisories/new) to submit a confidential report.
- Alternatively, open a new GitHub issue marked **Security** with minimal details and request a secure follow-up channel; a maintainer will respond promptly.

Please do not create public issues that include exploit details. We aim to acknowledge new reports within 3 business days and provide a status update within 7 business days.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| main branch | ✅ |

If you depend on a tagged release that is no longer supported, consider upgrading to the latest `main` build or reach out via the reporting channels above to discuss options.

## Preferred Language

Please submit reports in English so we can respond quickly and accurately.

Thank you for helping to keep LogoWallpaper and its users safe.
