LogoWallpaper is a SwiftUI macOS app for quickly generating clean brand wallpapers. Drag your logo into the window and the generator creates polished, watermark-free backgrounds that are ready for presentations or daily use.

## Usage

- Prepare a **watermark-free PNG** as the source logo and drop it into the app window to start generating wallpapers.
- If your artwork is in SVG format, convert it to PNG with the free tool at <https://www.svgviewer.dev/svg-to-png>.

Tweak colors, layout, and export settings to create wallpapers tailored to any display.
